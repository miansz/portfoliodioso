        <p> I honestly thought that CSS would be difficult for me as I have a hard time coding.
             And I am right, <span> but as time went on it became simpler. </span class="ohio">Sometimes I have a hard time 
             as my css won't link to my html file, or the style won't show up. But I actually had fun
              coding this time. As 2nd Quarter started, I feel like I have improved, except when I do Hands On since 
              I am a slow coder. My quizzes have been quite decent so far and I am proud of myself, hopefully. </p><br><br>

              <p> 2nd Quarter has only been the start of my improvement and I will try to do my best again on the 3rd. I 
               find myself having a better time memorizing information than doing codes though, but that is what I wish
                to improve on. Even though most of ICT time was given for collaborations, I stil learned a lot. With anticipation,
                 I wish 3rd Quarter would be more simpler, especially the Hands On. But aside from all of that, 
                 I actually enjoyed this quarter.</p>
